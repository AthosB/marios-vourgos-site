	'fashion designer in New York, the experience of singing opera in ancient\n' +
	'amphitheaters, or even my poetry. And then the universe somehow decided it\n' +
	'was about time to convince me to take myself seriously (enough), or at least\n' +
	'my artistic and creative ability. So, one day totally unexpectedly and without\n' +
	'warning, it somehow messed up with my old, ordinary, inexpensive digital\n' +
	'camera, and it simply started capturing images beyond space and time. As\n' +
	'simple as that…..\n' +
	'Our dog who died years ago appeared sitting on my daughter’s shoulder, a\n' +
	'woman posing for me appeared with a heavy black presence sitting on her lap,\n' +
	'another woman’s soul was captured escaping her substance, images that\n' +
	'cannot be explained in technological terms and modern/conventional logic.\n' +
	'Therefore, I embraced the unknown as part of everyday life. At least mine.\n' +
	'I kept these photographs private for many years, more than ten years… And\n' +
	'then prior to a solo painting exhibition I decided to print a couple of them on a\n' +
	'large scale, just to test if these could be shown along my paintings. When the\n' +
	'art curator looked at them for the first time, she exclaimed “and what the hell\n' +
	'is that?”. And when I explained that these were photographs non digitally\n' +
	'manipulated insisted to look at them through my digital camera to be\n' +
	'convinced. She carefully saw and closely observed all twenty-five, or so, of\n' +
	'them. And categorically decided that these photographs not only deserved but\n' +
	'demanded and had to be shown on their own.\n' +
	'It was there and then I finally got serious about something: my photographic\n' +
	'work. Over the next years I took more photographs meticulously setting the\n' +
	'settings and the mood, and most of the time using my daughter Athena as my\n' +
	'model. And over time the photographs became more “generous” revealing\n' +
	'more and more layers of truth, parallel universes or memories from the past,\n' +
	'and perhaps echoes from the future.';
